# Medicine-Recommendation-System üíä

![medicine-image](https://github.com/anurag-b72/medicine-recommendation-system/blob/main/images/medicine-image.jpg)

This recommendation system is supposed to recommend any medicine/drug on the basis of the search result.
The main aim is to recommend any alternative/substitute to be used in place of the searched medicine.

### Steps to Open Localhost for application: üåê
1. Clone the GitHub Repository.
2. Extract the **pickle-files.rar** archive; it will extract "similarity.pkl" & "medicine_dict.pkl" pickle files. Make sure the files are present in the root directory where the `app.py` is located.
3. Download PyCharm IDE and open this application folder in it.
4. Open the terminal.
5. Import the necessary libraries: *streamlit*, *pandas*, and *pickle*.
6. Run the application by typing `streamlit run app.py`.
7. If the application does not start, you can try typing `python -m streamlit run app.py`.

**Note**: If the terminal throws an error "*streamlit is not recognized as an internal or external command*" even after importing all libraries, recreate a new Python project, then import all libraries (*streamlit*, *pandas*, and *pickle*) and include the `css` & `images` folder along with the extracted pickle-files.

## Deployment and Data Files üì¶

To facilitate deployment and address GitHub's file size limit of 100 MB, we have reduced the size of the `similarity.pkl` file. However, the original data files required for the application are available in the `pickle-files.rar` archive.

Here's how to handle the deployment and retrieve the original data files:

1. **Reduced `similarity.pkl` File**: The reduced `similarity.pkl` file is provided in the root directory of this repository. This file is optimized for deployment and may contain a smaller subset of data. It is suitable for running the application in a production environment.

2. **Original Data Files**: To obtain the original data files used for development and testing, you will need to extract them from the `pickle-files.rar` archive. These files, `similarity.pkl` and `medicine_dict.pkl`, should be placed in the same directory as the application script `app.py` for full functionality.

   You can extract the files using various tools such as WinRAR, 7-Zip, or the `unrar` command-line utility:


Make sure the extracted data files are present in the root directory alongside `app.py` to ensure the application works with the complete dataset.

By following these instructions, you can deploy the application with the reduced `similarity.pkl` file while having access to the original data files when needed.
